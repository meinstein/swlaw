# Goals

* Iron out any issues with running your servers
* Sending data to the server from the client
* Receiving data on the server form the client

# Reading

* Read: [The eight-step recap of Session 3 email](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DoOoa3qMaQz9Nxf1x9oz956Y8WFcrkV94P4f-1juSPQ/edit?usp=sharing)
* Read: Read any resources from the first three sessions that you have not yet had a chance to
* Read: [jQuery's POST function](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/) - We will use this jQuery method to send data to the server. We will be adding this logic/code in the function that gets called whenever a user clicks the submit button. Recall what the purpose of your projects is: capturing the data submitted by users who visit your splash page and provide their information. This step allows us to send data to the server from the client, where we will then have ultimate freedom to store that data as we see fit.
