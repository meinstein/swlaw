# Goals

- Setting up and becoming familiar with a web development environment
- Web fundamentals: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- What does each of the aforementioned technologies do and how does it interact with the others

I encourage you to attempt the practice problems provided in the reading material. Also, I suggest that you supplement any confusing bits of the reading material with video tutorials and any other reading materials that you can  . The programming community is a very supportive one. There are lots of wonderful resources and forums easily accesible online. Chances are that almost any question you have has been answered before. Of course, I am also a resource to you and will be happy to answer your questions via email.

# Post-Class Updates:

### Recap
- We covered a lot of material today! We touched on: how to use the computer's terminal and create files from there, how to get started using a full-fledge text editor for coding, how to set up an HTML document, how to style our HTML elements using CSS and how to preview our work in the browser (not to mention, how to inspect our HTML elements and their associated styles using Google Chrome's inspector tools!). Great job.

### Going forward
- We did not get a chance to touch on the third language of web programming: JavaScript. That is totally fine. You will be reading more about this language more in advance of next week's class. JavaScript is what will allow us to make our webpages interactive - so start thinking about the snazzy features you want incorporated on your site! At this point we have a basic understanding of how to structure our content (HTML) and how to style that content (CSS). But what if you want to do something when a user clicks on a button? Well, for that type of interactivity, we'll need to leverage JavaScript. More to come next week! For this week's assignment, I'd like you to do the reading listed under next week's section, as well as continue to work on the websites you started on in today's class. I will post my example code below (see the 'Resources Mentioned During Class Section') for your convenience. Lastly, please make sure you brush up on the JavaScript reading from this week in case you did not get to it yet. We will be relying on this heavily for next session.

### Resources mentioned during class:
- [HTML Tags ordered by category](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp) - Here is a comprehensive list of valid HTML tags. Remember, tags are largely used to establish structural clarity. You could always just use a generic <div> tag to serve, for example, the same purpose as a <header> so long as you style things with CSS accordingly. But, at the end of the day, it'll be a lot simpler for you to work in a code base that uses HTML mark up that reinforces semantics in some meaningful way.
- [Color Names](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp) - Here is a list of 140 valid color names that can be used in your CSS. If you want a specific color not mentioned here, you can always just get the valid HEX code for that color and CSS will accept that, too.
- [The Code for Go Places Inc. (Session 1)](https://github.com/meinstein/swlaw/blob/master/session_1/index.html) - You may notice a bit of JavaScript in here, but you can safely ignore it for now (it's located at the bottom of the document, inside of the <script></script> tags.)
- [The live version of Go Places Inc.](https://meinstein.github.io/swlaw/session_1/index.html) - This is what the code for above looks like when it's rendered by a browser. Recall that you can use Google Chrome's inspector tool to examine the underlying HTML and CSS.
- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide contains all you need to know about working with Flexbox. Like I said in class, that is a very powerful method of positioning elements on the page. It may be initially confusing, but will prove invaluable once understood.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I know some of you asked about how to add custom fonts. This is a wonderful resource by Google that allows you to browse and select from hundreds of free fonts. Follow the selection process for directions on how to include the styles in your webpage. In short, you will be adding a <link></link> tag inside the Head of your document. Once included, you must simply add a font-family property in your CSS (along with the name of the font) anywhere you want to use it.
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) - Lastly, always remember that someone else on the internet has probably asked the exact question you're thinking about. Google, google, google! Or, email me, and I'll be happy to try and help! :)
