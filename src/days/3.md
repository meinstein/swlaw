# Goals

* jQuery review
* What is the distinction between a Client and a Server
* Setting up a server and interacting with it
* Getting started with Node.js
* Now that we have looked at front-end JavaScript frameworks, we are going to examine how we can also leverage JavaScript server-side.

# Reading

### Installing Node (PLEASE DO THIS BEFORE SESSION 3)

* Read: [How to Install Node.js and NPM (on a Mac)](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac) - Give yourself a bit of time with this. You will need two pre-requisites installed before you can get Node on your computer. Follow the directions carefully.
* Read: [How to Install Node.js and NPM (on a Mac) (Alternative)](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-node-js-tutorial-using-nvm-on-mac-os-x-and-ubuntu/) - Alternative if XCode does not install on your machine.
* Read: [How to Install Node.js and NPM (on Windows)](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) - The directions are relatively straight forward for PC users. Install Node like you would any other application.

### Server-side programming

* Read: [Introduction to the server side](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction)
* Read: [Client-Server overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview)
* Read: [Express/Node introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

* Read: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)

# Exercises

* Work on re-factoring the JavaScript logic we wrote in class using jQuery instead.
* Continue to style your web page using CSS (Google, as well as resources from pevious session, will be greatly helpful)

# Post-Class Updates

* [The Code for Go Places Inc. (Session 3)](https://github.com/meinstein/go-places-inc/tree/master/session_3) - Our code base is starting to look a lot different. Our index.html, styles.css and script.js files from the last session have been tucked away into a folder called static. We now also have a fully-functioning server called server.js that lives in the root of our project (alongside the static folder). You will also notice in the root that there is one more new file called package.json. This is a file that we generate so that Node.js is able to keep track of the modules required by our project. This is the equivalent of dropping a <script></script> into our index.html in order to pull in an external library like jQuery. The only difference in this case is that we are keeping the code for our external modules inside our project. Remember, Node.js does not run in the browser, and thus there is no guarantee that we can access the internet to pull in modules. We need a local copy.
